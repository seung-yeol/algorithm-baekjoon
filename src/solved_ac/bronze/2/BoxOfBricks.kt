/**
 * **문제**
 * Little Bob likes playing with his box of bricks.
 * He puts the bricks one upon another and builds stacks of different height.
 *
 * “Look, I’ve built a wall!”, he tells his older sister Alice.
 *
 * “Nah, you should make all stacks the same height. Then you would have a real wall.”, she retorts.
 *
 * After a little consideration, Bob sees that she is right.
 *
 * So he sets out to rearrange the bricks, one by one, such that all stacks are the same height afterwards.
 *
 * But since Bob is lazy he wants to do this with the minimum number of bricks moved. Can you help?
 *
 * **입력**
 * - The input consists of several data sets.
 * - Each set begins with a line containing the number n of stacks Bob has built.
 * - The next line contains n numbers, the heights hi of the n stacks. You may assume 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ hi ≤ 100.
 *
 * The total number of bricks will be divisible by the number of stacks.
 * Thus, it is always possible to rearrange the bricks such that all stacks have the same height.
 *
 * The input is terminated by a set starting with n 0. This set should not be processed.
 *
 * **출력**
 * - For each set, first print the number of the set, as shown in the sample output.
 * - Then print the line “The minimum number of moves is k.”, where k is the minimum number of bricks that have to be moved in order to make all the stacks the same height.
 *
 * Output a blank line after each set.
 *
